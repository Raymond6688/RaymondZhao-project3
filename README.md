# what your ebay-dl.py file does:
I used requests to download the first 10 webpage results for "girl toys", "hammer", "boy toys".
I created a python list of my extracted items.
I used json library to save the list as three json files.

# how to run your ebay-dl.py file:

```
yuchizhao@Yuchis-MacBook-Pro-2 Raymond.project3inCS40 % python3 ebay-dl.py 'hammer'

yuchizhao@Yuchis-MacBook-Pro-2 Raymond.project3inCS40 % python3 ebay-dl.py 'boy toys'

yuchizhao@Yuchis-MacBook-Pro-2 Raymond.project3inCS40 % python3 ebay-dl.py 'girl toys'
```
